## Project's Description:

The problem is similar to the Fibonacci algorithm problem. The most tempting way is to use recursion; however, it is very slow and needs to recalcualte the same calculations multiple times.

for example: ![Recursion-Tracing](https://willrosenbaum.com/assets/img/recursive-fibonacci/tree.png)

So the best solution to speed up the performance of the function is to place the calculated calues in a array. This technique is called memoization.
